# 🏦 Python Banking Project (Stage 2)

This project is a banking simulation system designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It manages accounts, transactions, and currency operations.

## 🚀 Features (Stage 2)
* **OOP Structure:** Implemented `Account`, `Money`, and `Transaction` classes.
* **Immutable Data:** The `Money` class is designed as a `dataclass` and is immutable for security.
* **Transaction History:** Keeps a detailed log of every deposit and withdrawal.

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented
1.  **Search Transaction:** Finds transactions based on keywords (e.g., "Market").
2.  **Balance Validation:** Recalculates and verifies the current balance by iterating through the history.
3.  **Exchange Rates:** Fetches real-time currency data (USD, EUR, GBP) from the web.

## 🛠️ How to Run
To run the project, execute the following command in the terminal:

python main.py
